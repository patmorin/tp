Referee:
L190 for the Lem 11 to make sense, the layering must have at least h parts and you must tell how you index the parts
L188 also, the informal statement talks about vertices at depth i but the lemma talks about parts in the path-partition
L195 here you say that P_i contains 2^i vertices, which is never argued it seems that some arguments are missing here. I continue reading under the (very strong) assumption that P_i contains exactly the depth-i vertices, but this needs justification  after reading it appears that P_i indeed refers to the depth-i vertices, and not the path-partition. so please adjust accordingly.


Author response:
Our apologies to the referee.  The confusion here is caused by the overloading of $P_x$ notation.  In the lemma and the text $P_i$, was referring to the path in $G_h$ that contains all the vertices of depth $i$. We have switched to calling this $D_i$.





L273 you could have introduced and used the compatible notion earlier
