Response to Referee:

We have addressed all of the referee's major comments. The most important of these was the overloading of the P_x notation, which meant four different things depending on whether x was a vertex in a path P, an integer, a vertex in the tree T_h, or a vertex in some other tree T.  We have split this into three notations:

- For i in {0,...,h} D_i is path that contains all vertices of depth i in the complete binary tree T_h of height h.

- Q_v is a path from a vertex v in T_h-S to a leaf-descendant of v

- P_x is bag in the path partition {P_x : x\in V(P)}.

- A_T(x) is the path from x to the root of the rooted tree T.

Our apologies to the referee for this, and our thanks to the referee for pushing through the paper despite this.
